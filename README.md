1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming room project is to develop a web-based game based on their current game “Draw it or Lose it”. However, since this is only available on android, 
  the need is for the game to be served on multiple platforms. The software needed to be designed to reach more players on different devices.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I was able to provide the customer with the information needed to be able to provide the best option for their business.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I think it really helped provide me with the different wants from the customer and helped keep my program on the right track and did not overlap with redundant unneeded code.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would probably revise the Development requirements, I think I would probably revise them to more concise and provide a more expert comments.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I tried to input the user needs when needed, but it is not always about what is wanted versus what they need. 
  For example if they only want to reach other mobile devices, they might not think about the apps being downlaoded on all devices versus just mobile ones. 
  
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

   I tried to design the software in w a way that is easy to use and understand. I looked at what the customer was needing done and try to find the best fit in reagrds to the different systems that could provide
   them with the correct information and needs. Some of the needs for this program to be sucessful can be used for different programs.
